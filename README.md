# Project Directory

These are some projects that I have done independently or for consultant work. This page aims to summarize previous projects and link to them to show some of my skillsets in statistics and data science. Everything here was written in R unless indicated otherwise.

# Statistics

### [Simulation Studies](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims)

This project contains elaborate examples of common statistical models using simulated data from hypothetical studies. Each markdown simulates, visualizes, and models the data. These steps are followed by an easily-understandable interpretation of the results in terms of the study. For more complex designs, the logic behind most steps are also explained. I currently have 4 completed:

* [Simple linear regression](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Simple_Regression/simple_regression.md)
* [t-test](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/t_test/t_test.md)
* [One-way ANOVA](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/one_way_anova/one_way_anova.md)
* [Multilevel model: factorial design](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Multilevel_Factorial/Multilevel_Factorial.md)
* [Logistic regression](https://github.com/atamalu/Applied-Stats-Sims/blob/master/Logistic_Regression/Logistic_Regression.md)

# Books

## [Analyzing and visualizing fiber photometry data with fluoR](https://bookdown.org/anta8363/fluoR_bookdown/)

This free online book is a continuously updated source of tutorials and background information for analyzing and visualizing fiber photometry time series data from behavioral experiments.

* The book focuses on how my fluoR package can be used to help with the process
* The book was written exclusively in R using bookdown, markdown, LaTeX, html, and more. 

# Dashboards & Presentations

## [COVID-19 Loans](https://github.com/atamalu/covid_loans)

I found some data on COVID-19 grants & loans that were gathered through SEC filings, so I decided to explore and visualize this data to answer some questions I've been having. Some of the results so far are surprising - especially how much money 5 airlines were given in grants relative to over 10,000 other companies. 

## [Market Research Scenario](https://atamalu.github.io/marketing-scenario-project)

I stumbled upon a market research scenario prompt that looked like a good way to work on presenting information using different style markdowns. The study design would likely be changed a few times along the way, but this seems like a decent framework for showing knowledge of research design for job applications and the like.
