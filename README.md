This free online book is a continuously updated source of tutorials and background information for analyzing and visualizing fiber photometry time series data from behavioral experiments.

* The book focuses on how my fluoR package can be used to help with the process
* The book was written exclusively in R using bookdown, markdown, LaTeX, html, and more. 

# Dashboards & Presentations

## [COVID-19 Loans](https://github.com/atamalu/covid_loans)

I found some data on COVID-19 grants & loans that were gathered through SEC filings, so I decided to explore and visualize this data to answer some questions I've been having. Some of the results so far are surprising - especially how much money 5 airlines were given in grants relative to over 10,000 other companies. 

## [Market Research Scenario](https://atamalu.github.io/marketing-scenario-project)

I stumbled upon a market research scenario prompt that looked like a good way to work on presenting information using different style markdowns. The study design would likely be changed a few times along the way, but this seems like a decent framework for showing knowledge of research design for job applications and the like.

# Functions

## fluoR Package
~~[cran version](https://github.com/atamalu/GCalcium)~~ (no longer supported) <BR>
[github version](https://github.com/atamalu/fluoR)

The functions in this R packages aim to expedite the data manipulation, exploration, and transformation processes that are useful in working with waveform data. I initially wrote the GCalcium package for a pilot study at University of Colorado when we were testing out GCaMP6 calcium fluorescence imaging, and have since re-written some of the functions for better speed and interpretability. The vignette for the cran version explains the functions in more detail.

## [StockGather](https://github.com/atamalu/StockGather)

These functions were made out of my interest in the stock market. The eventual goal is to re-write and use them to assess the market using 1.) sentimental analysis on news articles about stocks, and 2.) text mining of that company's financial documents. As of right now, it's an interactive way of pulling news articles on stocks and the respective company's financial documents.

## [BlueStacksADB](https://github.com/atamalu/BlueStacksADB) (Python)

These Python functions are essentially shortcuts in connecting to and controlling the BlueStacks android emulator. I wrote these functions so I could compile scripts that automate a few tedious processes in a mobile game I play. The included `MSMbot` files take advantage of these functions.

# Web Scraping

## [Scraping Fangraphs](https://github.com/atamalu/Scraping-Fangraphs)

I love fantasy baseball and FanGraphs is an incredible source of MLB data, so I wrote a small 3-part tutorial series. The first part teaches writing a relatively simple function that acts as a shortcut to searching on FanGraphs. The second part shows how to gather this data and turn it into a useable format in another function. Last, I give examples of some visualizations of the data and what they mean.

## [Introduction to NFL Data](https://github.com/atamalu/Intro-to-NFL-Data)

Fantasy football has also been growing on me. This series aims as a way to get R users started in NFL data acquisition, manipulation, and exploration. SQL is also used.

# Misc

## [CV Extra](https://github.com/atamalu/CV-Extra)

I wanted to compact some of the information that is relevant to my CV but not necessarily common inclusions. This is done through visualizations.
